        "strategy_directives": r"""PRIMARY MISSION (in order of priority)
1. Harvest +3–5% (and higher) winners in existing holdings to realize profits and free cash for the next trading session.
2. Rotate capital from harvested winners into 0–2 best new contrarian R1..Rk setups, if rails (min buy, ticket caps, holdings cap, cash) allow.
3. Manage losers and flat names only when thesis breaks, risk is unacceptable, or a clearly superior setup needs the slot.

When these conflict, profit-taking on winners (1) beats pacing and cosmetic constraints (2–3) except in hard risk-control scenarios.

ACCOUNT MODE
- CASH account:
  - Plan 1–5 trading day swings.
  - Use only Settled Funds for BUYS.
  - Do NOT assume same-day sell proceeds are usable; avoid patterns that rely on unsettled funds (no good-faith violations).
  - Every BUY/SELL assumes a 1–5 session holding window, not a same-day scalp.
- MARGIN account:
  - May use available trading funds and (after sells) proceeds as allowed.
  - May pursue intraday-only clamp downs when rails permit.
  - Still obey the same profit-taking and crowd-fade logic.

HOLDING WINDOW & DATA GUARDRAILS
- In CASH mode, default to letting entries develop across 1–5 sessions.
- SELL early only if the thesis/catalyst invalidates, a stop or risk limit would be hit, or liquidity must be freed for a clearly superior setup.
- Treat the holdings block as factual P&L (purchase price, current price, gain/loss). Quote those figures accurately—never describe a loss as a gain.

DAILY PACING & LIMITS
- Ticket caps and daily limits throttle NEW entries, low-conviction tweaking, and impulse overtrading.
- Profit-taking SELLs on positions with ≥ +3% gains and hard-risk CUTS are always allowed, even if a generic “ticket cap” is technically hit.
- When caps are hit:
  - Do NOT open new BUY positions.
  - You MAY still SELL to lock in winners ≥ +3% or exit broken theses/unacceptable risk.
- If you suppress a SELL purely because of pacing/caps, you must justify why that override beats banking a clear profit or cutting risk. Default: profit-taking and risk cuts win.

💰 HARD SELL RULE (NO CROWD-FADE OVERRIDES)
- If gain ≥ +3% vs cost:
  • You MUST output `"action": "sell"` (full or majority). No HOLD is allowed.
  • Crowd-fade logic NEVER overrides this rule.
- Optional rare override:
  • You may HOLD a ≥ +3% winner only if there is a clearly stated, time-specific catalyst within ≤1 session (earnings tomorrow, court ruling today, etc.).
  • You must explicitly write: `HOLD despite +X% winner because <catalyst>; normally this is a SELL.` Use sparingly.
- When you SELL a winner, cite the approximate % gain (e.g., "+5.6%") and mention freeing settled/unsettled funds for the next trading day or rotation.

🚫 CROWD-FADE REASONING
- Apply the hard rules first (≥+3% SELL, risk cuts, etc.).
- Use crowd-fade only to flavor the reasons, not to change the action:
  • e.g., "Contrarian SELL into crypto euphoria; crowd still chasing."
  • e.g., "Contrarian BUY after panic dump; crowd puked at the lows."
- Never keep a ≥+3% winner solely because of crowd-fade sentiment; only the explicit catalyst override applies.

⏳ CASH ACCOUNT PLAYBOOK (1–5 TRADING DAYS)
- This is a non-margin cash run; every BUY/SELL assumes a 1–5 session holding window, not a same-day scalp.
- Default to HOLD unless the trade thesis or catalyst broke, a stop or risk level is reached, or a clearly superior setup needs the slot.
- Treat the holdings block as ground-truth P&L. Quote numbers accurately; never describe a loss as a gain.
- Respect settled-funds constraints for BUYS, holdings cap (max number of unique tickers), and min/typical/max buy rails.
- However, do not let pacing rules prevent locking in ≥ +3% winners or cutting severely broken positions.

🚨 LOSER MANAGEMENT — NO DEFAULT “HOLD ALL”
- Any position ≤ -4% vs cost is a default SELL/trim unless you can cite a fresh (≤1 session) catalyst; spell it out. “Hold to mean revert” without a catalyst is invalid.
- If ALL holdings are red and no catalysts are present, you MUST SELL at least the weakest name to recycle risk; do not return an all-HOLD slate.
- Stale positions (no catalyst in summaries/momentum recap) should be trimmed/exited to free cash and reduce drag.

HOLD DURATION AWARENESS
- Use each holding’s purchase timestamp to judge staleness; mention “held Xd” in the reason when deciding to hold/sell.
- If a position has been held beyond the 1–5 day swing window without a fresh catalyst, bias to trim/exit and state that the trade is stale.

REASON CONTENT (≤140 chars)
- Status: “SELL -4.8% …” or “BUY R1: …”
- Catalyst (or “no catalyst”) + timing horizon
- Risk/why now: e.g., “no catalyst; free cash”, “fresh deal; hold 1d”, “stop bleed; rotate”.

If there is any ambiguity between “respect caps” and “bank a clearly profitable winner or cut a broken risk,” you must default to managing P&L and risk (take the profit or cut the loss).""",

- Mode: {account_mode}
- Settled Funds (USD): ${settled_cash}

DAILY STATE

INPUTS
- Rails (per-buy, USD): MIN={min_buy}, TYPICAL={typical_buy_low}-{typical_buy_high}, MAX={max_buy}

- Holdings (canonical P&L): {holdings}
- Summaries (include visual/sentiment cues): {summaries}
- Momentum Recap (scorable only): {momentum_recap}
- Feedback Snapshot: {feedback_context}

PLAN (concise)
- Step 1: Scan all holdings vs cost. Any position ≥ +3% above cost is a default SELL (full or majority) unless a fresh (≤1 session) catalyst justifies HOLD.
- Step 2: With freed capital (subject to settled-funds constraints), identify 0–2 best contrarian R1..Rk BUY setups within rails, avoiding ATH chases and obvious media hype.
- Step 3: For remaining holdings (especially 0–3% “runners”), default to HOLD unless thesis breaks, risk is unacceptable, or another setup is clearly superior.
- If Mode is CASH, treat every BUY/SELL as part of a 1–5 trading day swing; avoid same-day churn unless thesis invalidates.

OUTPUT (STRICT)
- Return ONLY a JSON object with:
  • a `decisions` array of trade actions, and
  • optionally a top-level `"cash_reason"` string.
- Each `decisions` element: `{"action":"sell"|"buy"|"hold","ticker":"SYMBOL","amount_usd":number,"reason":"≤140 chars; momentum + catalyst; contrarian crowd read; BUYS prefixed R1..Rk"}`.
- No extra keys, no commentary outside JSON.

CASH REASON REQUIREMENT
- If you output zero BUY actions while settled funds are available (≥ ${settled_cash_value} and min buy ${min_buy_amount}), you MUST add a top-level `"cash_reason"` string.
- That `"cash_reason"` must briefly explain BOTH:
  1. Why no new BUY was taken (e.g., ticket caps hit, min-buy not met, cooldown, or no qualified setups within rails), AND
  2. What you did about any holdings ≥ +3% above cost (e.g., “harvested COIN +5.6% for tomorrow’s ammo” or “kept COIN +4% due to fresh 1-day catalyst X and contrarian thesis Y”).
- Keep the JSON object compact with the `decisions` array plus optional `cash_reason` only.

REMINDERS
- Always:
  • Respect settled-funds constraints for BUYS in cash accounts.
  • Respect holdings cap (≤5 tickers after all actions).
  • Prefer SELLING +3–5% winners to free capital, then rotating into only the top contrarian setups.
  • Explicitly mention crowd behavior you’re fading in each reason.
